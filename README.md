I have always been a very curious and driven person, I love to learn and broaden my skillset. I mainly focus on the technical part of game art: scripting, shaders, 
procedural assets, real-time VFX etc. As my hobby I love to sculpt, 3D print and paint.

On my github you can find some of my scripting projects!
